# 7-Zip-Dictionary-Attack


Coded in batch (DOS/Windows shell script executed by the DOS/Windows command interpreter), this script will brute force password protected 7-zip files automatically.


Interested in scripting, I stumple upon batch and found it interesting as I can directly give input to the command prompt in the script. Decided to challenge myself by making a mini project that will brute force the password of the password protected 7-zip file (dictionary attack). 


Manage to did it successfully but I have further plans on it to imrpove my skills in this language. Wanted to give user options to make use of multiple threads but I was stuck at the 'array' side of things (there is no such thing as array in batch). Will definitely improve on this script in the near future and I will update it when I have a fully working script that gives user option on threads and display the time taken.


## Usage


Execute the file and enter the 7-zip filename, wordlist filename, and the output filename.


*Do note that the 7-zip file and wordlist file need to be in the same directory*

Once you press `Enter`, the attack will start


*Used fasttrack wordlist + the password*
