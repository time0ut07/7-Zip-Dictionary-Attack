# 7-Zip-Dictionary-Attack


Coded in batch (DOS/Windows shell script executed by the DOS/Windows command interpreter), this script will brute force password protected 7-zip files automatically.


## Usage


Execute the file and enter the 7-zip filename, wordlist filename, and the output filename.


*Do note that the 7-zip file and wordlist file need to be in the same directory*

Once you press `Enter`, the attack will start


*Used fasttrack wordlist + the password*

## Plans


Still figuring out how to make multiple threads to make everything faster. Going to add in a timer as well when I can do that.
